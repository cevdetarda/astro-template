# Astro Template

Welcome to the Astro Template, a lightweight and high-performance web development template powered by Astro.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start a new project using this template, you can use the following command:

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template astro-template
```

## 📁 Project Structure

Inside your Astro project, you'll find the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── robots.txt
├── src/
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   ├── Layout.astro
│   ├── pages/
├── ├── consts.ts
└── package.json
```

- **`public/`**: This directory contains important public files for your project.

    - **`favicon.ico`**: Customize the website's favicon.ico to match your branding.
    
    - **`robots.txt`**: Modify the `Sitemap` directive in `robots.txt` to point to your site's sitemap: `Sitemap: [YOUR_URL]/sitemap-index.xml`.

- **`src/consts.ts`**: This file contains configuration constants for your Astro project, including metadata and default settings.

- **`src/layouts/`**: Layout components for your pages are located here. You typically won't need to modify `Layout.astro` as it's dynamically generated by `src/consts.ts`.

- **`src/pages/`**: Create as many pages as needed in this directory. Each file automatically becomes a route based on its name.

- **`src/assets/`**: Although not included by default, you can create this directory to optimize your images using Astro's image optimization capabilities.

- **`src/components/`**: Although not included by default, you can create this directory to store various types of components used in your project.

- **`src/content/`**: While this directory isn't included by default, you can create it to manage your content.

    - **`config.ts`**: Define your content collections in this file and customize them to fit your specific requirements.

- **`package.json`**: Your project's configuration file.

Don't forget to update the base URL of your project by modifying the `site` value in `astro.config.mjs` to match your project's URL.

Feel free to adapt and organize your project's structure as needed. You can also create folders like `src/assets/`, `src/components/`, `src/content/` to better align with your project's goals and content management needs.
